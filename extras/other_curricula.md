- [Cultural Heritage Science Open Source (CHSOS) Training Resources](https://chsopensource.org/training/) – Practical, open-source focused training in heritage science and technical examination.
- [Arches Open Source Heritage Inventory Platform Resources](https://www.archesproject.org/resources/) – Guides and learning materials for digital heritage management using the open-source Arches platform.
- [UNESCO Dive into Intangible Cultural Heritage Platform](https://ich.unesco.org/en/dive) – Interactive explorations and resources on intangible heritage (supplements the MOOC).
