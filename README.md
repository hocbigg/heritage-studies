# Summary

The Heritage Studies curriculum is a **complete education in Heritage Studies** using online materials.

Heritage Studies is an interdisciplinary field examining the identification, interpretation, preservation, management, and contestation of cultural and natural heritage. It draws from anthropology, history, archaeology, museum studies, law, policy, and sociology, emphasizing both tangible (sites, objects) and intangible (traditions, practices) elements.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).
