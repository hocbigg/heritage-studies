# Summary

The Heritage Studies curriculum is a **complete education in Heritage Studies** using online materials.

Heritage Studies is an interdisciplinary field examining the identification, interpretation, preservation, management, and contestation of cultural and natural heritage. It draws from anthropology, history, archaeology, museum studies, law, policy, and sociology, emphasizing both tangible (sites, objects) and intangible (traditions, practices) elements.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.
